Development Process:
During our first meeting, we collectively decided to work on a Task Manager program. We allocated responsibilities according to each member's expertise and interest. Throughout the development phase, we maintained communication and shared code snippets to address challenges and ensure consistent progress.

Challenges and Solutions
-Search Function Issue: Daniel and Kirston encountered a challenge with the search function failing to display results. We collaborated to identify and resolve the issue by debugging the search functionality.

-Saving Data to Disk: Alaba faced difficulty in saving data to disk, resulting in the loss of inputed data. He took time implementing it which delayed the implementation a little bit, but he ended up fixing the error. 

-Decision on Destroy Function: There was a minor disagreement regarding the importance of the destroy function. After like an half hour discussion, we collectively agreed to rmove it from the final implementation to prevent drawbacks in the program.


Final Outcome:
Upon completion, our Task Manager program ran smoothly, with all features functioning as intended. We successfully integrated our individual contributions into a cohesive solution, ensuring seamless task management functionality.

File Sharing and Collaboration
We Used Outlook mail and a shared Git repository for better file sharing and collaboration. Despite minor meeting-time conflicts, we effectively coordinated our efforts to deliver a comprehensive solution.
